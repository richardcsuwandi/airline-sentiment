## About the Dataset
The dataset was scraped from Twitter in February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, 
followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service"). The data originally came from [Crowdflower's Data for Everyone library](
